            <h3>Linked Data and Apps (LinDA)</h3>
            <p>The purpose of LinDA is to be able to do a quick study of all the existing data and app, which reuse certain datasets. You can log in as a member of the research team and start adding datasets or apps to the system. All the fields are collected using the DCAT, FOAF and ODAPPS vocabularies. Using the triple dump, you should be able to use the collected fields as a start for a Data and Apps catalog.</p>
            <p>LinDA is an open-source product developed by iMinds. You can contribute or set it up yourself by <a href="https://github.com/pietercolpaert/linda" target="_blank">forking us on github</a>.</p>
